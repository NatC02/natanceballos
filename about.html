                <h4>About:</h4> 
                <p>
                  I always write to share insightful thoughts/ideas, so creating an "about me" feels counterproductive. So this is dedicated to sharing myself without the intention of transmitting ideas between my mind and yours.
                </p>
                  
                <h4>About Me:</h4> 

                <p>                      
                  <i>More than anything, I love sharing ideas.</i> Every article, book, video, website inspires me to write. 
                  And I can't help but share thoughts.
                </p>
                <p>               
                  I also want to <i>learn</i> many things, like different ways of thinking and living. That's partly why I consume/read alot of non-fiction, and explore other cultures. 
                </p>

                <p>               
                  <i>I prioritize learning and creation in most aspects of my life.</i> 
                  
                  <!-- I purposely shape my life to a routine. I'm not the type to go to parties, chill, hangout, watch TV, etc. -->
                  
                  There are many things I haven't done yet, but I don't feel bad if I don't go to parties or watch popular TV shows.
                  I often get too focused on the future behind what I experience, so my mind constantly interrupts "enjoying leisure". 
                </p>

              <h4>My Philosophy of Thought</h4>
              
              <p>              
                <!-- I'm very skeptical. Almost to a fault.  -->
                
                Anything that I write is valid at the time I've written it within current-Me's mind. As well as anything that I say. So I'm very much likely to be wrong on stuff. Sometimes, I entertain an idea that I am completely opposed to in order to gain a different perspective.
              </p>

              <p>               
                During high school, I read alot so I can somehow map the "adult life" ahead of time. Reading refined my ambitions for the ideas I had before/after I read.

                <!-- I've never liked working for "the man" as they say.  -->
              </p>



              <h4>Individualist</h4>

              <p>              
                During my childhood, having always moved around (every 5-7 years) due to my parents' seperation. As a result, I developed a desire to keep moving and avoid settling down in one place permanently. My cultural norms are probably stereotypically American, but there are unexpected outliers. Some of them below: 
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Family ties weak, nomadic (United States)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Devoted to career (Japan)
                  <!-- (I don't like the idea of saying "work". All I'm doing is sharing my ideas and hundreds of millions of people have been doing it for centuries by talking or writing and not getting paid for it. I like to say that "work" is a pathway for me to sustain my writing).  -->
                  
                  <!-- So I get more value working than when I don't). -->
                </li>
                <li>
                  Nontraditional, questioning norms (United States)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Quick meals (United States)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reserved but curious (Japan)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Seeking new ideas and people (United States)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Genuine smiles (German)
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <h4>Minimalist</h4>

              <p>
                I dislike excess possessions. This also applies to coding. My ideal website is hand-written with no frameworks used. In my writing, I throw as many thoughts on the page and backspace unnecessary ones. My goal is to live with:                
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  2x pair of white shirts
                </li>
                <li>
                  2x pair of colored shirts
                </li>
                <li>
                  1x pair of cashmere sweaters
                </li>
                <li>
                  1x pair of shorts
                </li>
                <li>
                  3x pair of underwear
                </li>
                <li>
                  3x pair of socks
                </li>
                <li>
                  1x pair of shoes
                </li>
                <li>
                  1x Laptop
                </li>
                <li>
                  1x Phone
                </li>
                <li>
                  4x languages
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Family</h4> 

              <p>
                <!-- Man, my family may read this in the future, so I have to be extra conscious.  -->
                
                I would say my family is neither bad nor good, just...there. I don't think blood being thicker than water shapes my perception of family. I don't feel any greater sense of obligation or attachment to my immediate family compared to strangers. Probably why I've always been interested in things that don't pertain to my culture exactly (American or Dominican). 
                <!-- That's why I prefer to focus on exploring the unknown and venturing further into the world, given my ambitious nature. -->
              </p>

              <h4>More about me</h4>

              <p>
                I might come across as a complete hermit, but I'm not. Most people who meet me tend to see me as a complete extrovert because I love one-on-one conversations. 
              </p>

              <h4>Music</h4> 

              <p>
                Listening to music is like my love for one-on-one conversation. I listen to music to connect with the emotions the song brought out in me. It's a one-to-one relationship between the song and me.
                Ideally, I listen to a video game soundstrack, not knowing the artist. And I experience the emotions I felt when I played the game and focus on the music itself. Not knowing any personal information about the artist.  
              </p>

              <p>
                This might seem like I lack art passion. But my indifference to music makes it hard to connect with people in most musical situations.
              </p>


<!--                 


              <p>               
                I enjoy learning and exploring new ideas, especially if they challenge my current beliefs or way of life or if they strike at the core of who we are as people ("It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it"). In the past, I have found it difficult to relate to people who prioritize relaxation and leisure over personal growth and development. I remember in high school, I found many interactions with people pointless because I didn't quite understand why someone would benefit from putting on a show in front of everybody for laughs.
              </p>
              <p>                      
                It's no surprise that sometimes I cut out certain activities like YouTube to focus on my goals with almost a tunnel vision-like focus. I'm also always looking to improve professionally because it's a way to put food on the table and afford being a writer (even though I'm still trying to figure out what that means). The ideal version of myself would say that my life is optimized for creating and learning rather than relaxing and going through the motions. Sometimes it leads to being overwhelmed, and ironically enough, I fall back on optimizing.
              </p>
              <p>                  
                In high school, during lunch, I used to sit alone because I wanted to optimize my passion, which is focused around coding. There were also countless stories of rejection during this time too because I practically asked out every girl within a 10 feet radius of me that I liked. It wasn't for a lack confidence, more so I justified it by saying "Well, soon I'm gonna be adult and this is what I'll maybe go through. If I go through rejection now, then I won't have much of a problem when I'm an adult. if I get a date, then alls good." It was cold the way I approached "dating". But it somehow made sense, I said the purpose for having a number was to go out on a date, not to talk and text. Very weird time. 
              </p>

              <h4>Timeline for Context:</h4> 
              <p>                  
                I started this website in 2023, as a way to explore my ideas.  
                I'm focused on writing for myself primarily. This entire page holds no value to you. 
                
                
                It's like being on a plane with strangers and one of them walks around with a paper taped to they're back about themselves. Nobody cares.  but 
                
              </p> -->

              <h4>The purpose in my writing</h4> 

              <p>                  
                I enjoy sharing my ideas and seeing people get excited by them, whether they're controversial, unanswered questions, or loosely related concepts. It's interesting to see how others think about the same ideas.


                <!-- In my writing I don't try to control what you should be thinking. Quite frankly, I don't care if you agree with me or not. If you agree or disagree I don't give two shits. What I want to do is "strike a tingle" or a je ne sai quois in you, based on my own pattern of thinking. Thats it. I don't care about being right. Or if you think my writing makes sense. The purpose in my writing is for you to have an innate sense of curiosity, and it makes you think about what you've read filtered through my own unique lense of the world. I throw ideas at the wall and see if something sticks. If my thoughts make you think critically about a certain piece of information or the ideas that I put forth, the rest will work itself out. This is also the reason I don't push narratives down peoples throat through my writing. If I read something (it's good to have an opinion) and the writing just comes across as pushing something down my throat that I don't want. An idea, an ideology, I'm quite frankly not going to care. This is even more noticible in writing. So I do my best to try to avoid it. I'm sure theyre plenty of people like me, so I write for those types of people. -->
              </p>

              <h4>Questions? Thoughts?</h4>

                Please email me at <a href="mailto:nat@natanceballos.com">nat@natanceballos.com</a> to introduce yourself. I enjoy talking to people from all over the world and starting conversations. You don't have to ask a question, but if something I wrote made you think of a parallel in your own life, feel free to reach out. I love discussing ideas and I try my best to respond to everyone.
