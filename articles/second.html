                <h4>AI Hype: A Free-Flowing Conversation</h4>
                <p>
                  With all the buzz about Artificial Intelligence, I feel compelled to chime in with my two cents. The other day, I caught up with a long-lost friend, and our chat quickly turned to the implications of AI. And let me tell you, we covered a lot of ground. So, grab a drink and get ready for some spontaneous and thought-provoking insights (or ramblings, depending on your perspective).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Consider this a stream-of-consciousness entry, where I'll share some of the ideas that have been occupying my mind lately. 
                </p>

                <h4>Fields and Feudal Lords</h4>
                <p>
                  One of the earliest instances we discussed was that of the humble peasants who made up the majority of human history. They were subjected to a feudal administration, where they toiled the land they were beholden to their lords for. Therefore, one of the most groundbreaking creations during this period was the animal-drawn cultivator, which substituted the manual hoe. Just imagine the elation of a peasant who was given access to such a marvel. This invention saved them countless hours of labor. It's easy to picture a peasant hitting the "griddy," as the kids these days say.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Suddenly, I, as a humble medieval peasant who only worked for half a year, could travel to distant places and stop by taverns for rest. All because I had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWjQ230ZJao">a DIY handcart</a> to relieve myself of the heavy load I could be carrying. Maybe this was medieval chatGPT, a way for me to connect with fellow travelers on the road, albeit with fewer emojis and memes.
                </p>

                <h4>Web's World Wide Wonderland</h4>                
                <p>
                  The internet was supposed to be the belle of the ball, the technology that would take communication to new heights. And boy, did it deliver. The internet has become an integral part of our lives, with accessibility and connectivity reaching unprecedented levels. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273018/number-of-internet-users-worldwide/">As of 2022, 62% of the world is online.</a> However, as with any new development, human nature had to rear its head, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Dot-com_bubble">dot com bubble of the late 90s was a prime example of our tendency to get carried away.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, even in the early days of the internet, we saw both progress and stagnation. That's right, folks, it's what I like to call "more of the same." Not the most popular phrase, but hear me out.  The internet made it possible for us to communicate across the entire world <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKHZKTRyzeg">(thank you, underwater cables).</a> Yet human patterns and tendencies crept their way in.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For as much as the internet has the potential to bring together different cultures and backgrounds, it can also perpetuate discrimination and inequality. And let's not forget about anonymity and privacy. They can be double-edged swords, leading to a lack of accountability and responsibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But that's not all. The internet is a vast sea of content, yet it can still leave us feeling like we're drowning in sameness and conformity. And while it's supposed to be a platform for self-expression, it can also lead to self-censorship and social conformity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the rise of AI, these complexities will only be highlighted further. For as much as we like to think we're evolving with technology, the truth is, we're still grappling with the same old human problems. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The internet is like a never-ending high school cafeteria, but with a twist. There are bubbles catering to every possible demographic or interest out there, much like the jocks and cheerleaders of old. Except, in today's world, we have subreddits and facebook groups. It's like the jocks and cheerleaders have been replaced by keyboard warriors and meme lords.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And let's not forget the early adopters of the internet. While the rest of the world was still trying to figure out what an email was, these hobbiest pioneers were busy sharing cat photos, making memes, and cracking jokes (some of which were a little tasteless, but hey, that's the internet for you). They were also dealing with the fear fueled by news reports warning of potential abuse - kind of like what's going on with chatGPT right now. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technophobia"> Reminds me of Technophobia to an extent</a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fc1P-AEaEp8">And this.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, amidst this chaos, something remarkable emerged. The internet paved the way for web-based services and novel business opportunities, transforming into the behemoth we witness today.
                </p>
                
                <h4>From Farming to Factories</h4>                
                <p>
                  During the Industrial Revolution, several inventions revolutionized manufacturing, such as the Spinning Jenny created by James Hargreaves in 1764 and the James Watt engine, which was widely utilized during this period. In 1793, Eli Whitney patented an iteration of the cotton machine, which was capable of producing cotton fiber at an even faster rate. This expedited the demand for cotton in the textile industry. Suddenly, we could produce cotton faster than a cheetah on roller skates, which, in turn, fueled America's cotton production. Despite these benefits, society had to regulate and standardize the use of these physical tools to address their associated effects. This makes me think about the current landscape of AI generated visuals (art, gifs, vids, etc...).
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, the abundance of cotton led to a price collapse, which prompted the "Gone to Texas" (GTT) movement some decades later. Essentially, a large number of people from the antebellum South ran away, settling in Texas. Economic factors such as debt and the collapse of the cotton market led to this.
                </p>

                <h4>Nature's Most Complicated Creature</h4>             
                <p>
                  Take human nature, for example. We crave connection. That's where the internet comes in — it's made it even easier to find and connect with those who share our views and values. But here's the kicker: while we were promised more openness and possibilities, what we've actually gotten is "more of the same."
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's like ChatGPT, except humans have a tendency to cling to the familiar. Who needs to bother with learning a new language or embracing different customs when you can stick to what you know? 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The real challenge will be addressing the advancements that pose a threat to traditional human capital and breaking the mold of human nature. We will need to partially and fundamentally redefine how we think of and define human capital due to the continuing advancements in AI that affect social norms. Additionally, there is a tension between current advancements that require specific skills or knowledge and the more general skills and qualities that have traditionally been valued in human capital, regardless of the career stage of job applicants.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Regarding the notion of "breaking the mold of human nature," I think we'll have to increase our awareness of innate human tendencies and behaviors that are common to all of us. These traits include self-preservation, socialization, and the desire for companionship. If AI is poised to redefine our output as humans, then breaking the mold means going against our natural inclinations and redefining what it means to be human in the face of advancing technology...? This can also entail challenging patterns of behavior and thought reinforced by societal norms and expectations that limit our potential and prevent us from exploring new avenues of thought. Additionally, we must work to overcome human-centered biases, such as favoring people who are similar to us or perceiving threats where there are none. These biases may be influenced by our historical and cultural contexts, and our beliefs and values may limit our ability to imagine new possibilities. To think and act in innovative ways, we need to challenge our own assumptions about what is possible in social contexts.

                  At this point, we may experience "more of the same" unless we address the language gap that exists between different human tongues.






                  When it comes to "breaking the mold of human nature," we have to acknowledge our inherent tendencies and behaviors that we all share. You know, things like looking out for ourselves, craving social interaction, and seeking companionship. But if AI is about to shake things up, then we need to redefine what it means to be human by going against our natural inclinations. That means breaking free from the patterns of behavior and thought that society has drilled into us, and opening ourselves up to new possibilities.

                  But we can't stop there. We also need to overcome our human biases, like always favoring people who are just like us, or imagining threats where there aren't any. Our biases are often shaped by our cultural and historical contexts, and they can limit our ability to think outside the box. To truly innovate, we need to challenge our own assumptions about what's possible.
                  
                  And let's be real here, folks. Unless we can bridge the language gap between different cultures, we're just going to keep seeing more of the same.






                </p>

                <h4>Lingual Lingo: The Language of Interpretation</h4>                
                <p>
                  Understanding the precise tone and intention behind a speaker's words can sometimes avert tragedies. Idioms are a classic example of this; they're like secret handshakes that let another group know that you're one of them. And if they respond positively, well then hot damn, we've got ourselves a zinger! This phenomenon is not confined to just idioms though; it exists in all languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mandarin, employs phrases that might not seem significant on the surface, but they carry a wealth of national history and ideas. We could describe this as colloquialism or jargon instead of idioms, but in essence, it amounts to the same thing.
                </p>
    
                <h4>16th Century's Grisliest Grapple</h4>               
                <p>
                  Historians love to cite the meeting between Hernan Cortes, the Spanish conquistador, and Montezuma II, the Aztec ruler. The two were strangers to each other, with no prior knowledge or understanding of their respective cultures. During their first meeting, Cortes wanted to embrace Montezuma passionately, but he was restrained by Montezuma's group, and they instead bowed to each other. This meeting had significant context, as the Aztecs had never encountered Europeans before, and vice versa. The Aztecs were totally freaked out by the Spanish's horses (never seen those before!) and their fancy, high-tech weapons. Meanwhile, Cortes was blown away by the Aztecs' wealth and civilization. However, neither side had any ill intentions towards the other. There was no "Stop right there, criminal scum!" followed by a "Must have been the wind." 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cortes had two translators with him during the meeting. The first was a prisoner woman named Malinche, who knew the Aztec language, Nahuatl, and Mayan. The other translator was a priest named Geronimo del Aguilar, with whom Cortes conversed back in Spanish. The translation was, therefore, a chain of ideas from one person to another, with the longer the chain, the more information was lost. It was almost like the classic game of "Chinese Whispers" (or "Telephone," for my American friends) - you know, that game where one person whispers a phrase into someone's ear, who then passes it on to the next person, and so on, until the final recipient inevitably hears something completely different.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                  If you have a vague idea of what happened next from your history class, you might wonder how this meeting could lead to the bloodiest battle of the sixteenth century. 
                </p> -->

                <h4>Unfamiliarity's Subtle Complexities</h4>
                <p>
                  There was a hint of subtle undertones in the air. You see, after an extravagant dinner in the palace, Montezuma decided to give a speech. What started as a simple exchange of words quickly spiraled into a comical display of linguistic tomfoolery. Yes, you read that right - tomfoolery. Such a delightful word that exudes a certain contemporary charm, don't you think?
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the point is that large monologue chunks of Montezuma, larger than life in stature, were concessions. The Spaniards took a liking to what they effectively heard:
                </p>
                <p>
                  That Cortes and his crew were divine beings fulfilling the prophecy of a banished god's return from the east. The cherry on top? Montezuma himself was expected to surrender to Cortes. It's hard to fathom what must have gone through Cortes' mind as he left that meeting. Perhaps something along the lines of "we're about to go all-in at Ponchinki." That, my friends, was a true Hotel Trivago moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To put it bluntly, we all know that Montezuma had something else entirely in mind. Like idioms, there was a way to express reverence without explicitly saying so. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, relied on this type of speech to communicate. 
                </p>

              <p>
                Sergei is not here. I just made up the most stereotypical russian name. But this reminds me of the "Holy Fool" Russian folklore story.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Holy Fool is an outcast within the veins and arteries of society. But the Holy Fool has access to the heart. The truth. In the story, there is a painting of the Virgin Mary and while everyone else admires it. Our smart and bravado child, Sergei, doesn't. He claims its the work of Satan. The devil. 
              </p>
              <p>
                As the tension in the room reached its boiling point, it was as if everyone suddenly turned into Olympic-level table flippers, scratching their necks with a ferocity that would make a meth addict blush, and channeling their inner Winter Soldier. It's a baseless claim. Until, someone throws a stone at the work of art and the illusion is broken. Behind the painting people adored, the face of Satan is revealed.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Take for example the boy from Hans Christian Andersen's, "The Emperor's New Clothes". The child acknowledges the fancy new robe of the king. The king is told that his new robe is magical. And that those who do not notice the new garment are incompetent at their jobs. Nobody points out that he's actually naked. With the exception of the naive child, oblivious to societal taboos. Ironically, the boy acknowledged the robe, and maybe he acknowledged something else too. In any case, we know that there is an active societal difference in communication and perception of class by the different ways someone decides to communicate.
              </p>



              <h4>Verbose Past</h4>
              <p>
                Let's discuss the word "shit." Back in the Victorian era, uttering this word was like committing a cardinal sin. But nowadays, we're allowed to toss it around once in a PG-13 movie without causing too much of a stir. The association of these words to the common man made them more "filthy" to use. For instance, "culo" in Spanish is perceived as taboo, while in another part of the world, the word may be less harsh, depending on the education level of the person and their awareness of world differences. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The more "distinguished and educated" among us (read: snobs) replace such words with fancier euphemisms, like "fecal matter" for "shit" or "nalga" for "culo". Nevertheless, there's a subtle nuance to language that only a few can grasp, much like the waters Cortes's translators had to navigate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Language changes over time. For example, everyday terms may gain new meanings through a "euphemism cycle." Now, I'm not one to stir the pot, but the name "Chinese Whispers" might rub some people the wrong way. The name may be perceived as derogatory because it implies that the Chinese language is incomprehensible or challenging to understand. However, the game itself is not inherently derogatory, and school children play it without intending to be offensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'd like to preface that there's nothing wrong with euphemisms. They're typically used out of concern, recognizing the feelings of another person, or to avoid discussing a socially or culturally taboo topic. However, within the euphemism cycle, a word that passes through this process can become a slur. I'd love to give you examples, but I fear I've already hit my daily quota of "naughty" words, and I don't want to risk getting in trouble.
              </p>
              <p>
                In general, this type of behavior that defies categorical imperatives is probably seen across all languages worldwide. It's a distinctly human pattern, no matter where we go.
              </p>

              </p>



              <h4>Now, back to our boy, Montezuma</h4>
              <p>
                He was the master of false humility, a skill he and his peers considered the pinnacle of class in good-nature. Maybe Cortes thought the same when he tried to affectionately embrace Montezuma in the beginning. Who knows? But the practical terms were clear: in Nahuatl, the word "noble" is nearly identical to "child." Montezuma spoke in code, referring to himself as weak and small, but those close to him knew he was really flaunting his power and the center of high-falutin' status.
              </p>

              <!-- <h4>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</h4>
              <p>
                It's probably similar to my last CRPG playthrough of Pathfinder: Kingmaker, where the Goblins and my offbeat party decided to have a drink, getting hungover than a horse in the summertime heat. But they didn't attack me immediately. I had the option, but I decided to gain more experience points by prolonging the interaction with them. Perhaps "Lady Luck" was shining down on me, or maybe my charisma is just too irresistible. Either way, it was a memorable encounter that proved once again that sometimes, taking a chance and going off the beaten path can lead to unexpected rewards.
              </p> -->
              <p>
                The point is that overlooking the nuance of language eliminates the soul we find in human compassion. We might even lose sight of what's really being conveyed, just like Malinche and Geronimo del Aguilar must have felt.
              </p>


              <h4>AI and the Moral Time Warp</h4>
              <p>
                How do we keep up with values that are constantly changing like a chameleon on a color wheel? Despite the fact that many parts of the world still make claims that stereotype people based on their religion or geographical location,
                <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street">we must acknowledge that such claims are baseless.</a>
                There are significant disparities within countries and striking similarities between countries with comparable income levels, regardless of their diverse cultures or religious beliefs. It is fascinating to see how <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article/34/4/443/170733/Explaining-fertility-transitions">gender roles can transform quickly across all societies as wealth increases and living standards become more modern.</a> However, some cultures that place a higher value on extended families may experience a slightly slower pace of transformation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Similar to how language evolves, so do our values. Today, Sweden is recognized for its liberal attitude towards sex and contraception, but back in the 1930s and even the 60s, things were vastly different. In the 1960s, abortion was illegal in most cases, but that is no longer the case. Sweden has emerged as a leader in championing women's rights, and it has a deep-rooted connection with this aspect of their culture. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Cultural values are frequently shared worldwide. For example, the "typical conservative wife" who is responsible for taking care of both husband's parents and the children is prevalent in several Asian countries, such as South Korea and Japan. Many men are content with this arrangement as it is part of their culture. Who knows, maybe even I would be okay with it if I grew up in that kind of culture. It's like the age-old debate of nature vs. nurture, isn't it? 
              </p>
              <p>
                Even though some men label these types of values as "Asian values," women may have a different perspective. They may find these cultural norms unbearable and be less inclined to get married. So, these values that are widespread across the globe may not be as unique as we think.
              </p>
              <p>
                The thing is, many of these values are patriarchal values that were widespread in Sweden back in the 60s and even before that. But as we've seen, things change over time, just like values. Some of these values will fade away, as they have in modern-day Sweden. This is just another aspect of the human-centered complexity that AI will have to contend with, much like the internet did before it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Will AI worsen this human-centered issue or strive to unify everyone on the same wavelength? What does that even mean? How do we address current concerns? For instance, many people can perceive the difference between dialogue in Hollywood movies from the 80s and today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Will models adapt to cultural and societal changes? Will we be able to discern and pinpoint these changes in the media we consume 10 to 20 years from now? Or will it continually remain contemporary? It's a strange idea to always keep up with our communication demands.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is another form of the human-centered complexity that AI must navigate, similar to the internet. Will it resemble the modern internet, where we have bubbles separated by language barriers?
              </p>

              <h4>Scoops with Silicon Snoops</h4>
              <p>
                Picture me, a novice investigator, attempting to fact-check a historical event. Now, imagine I ask leading questions. The model I'm using is trained on publicly available resources and broad discussions. 
              </p>
              <p>
                However, how much in-depth knowledge is required to produce a transparent answer? Can omitting certain details be classified as misinformation? What if the information has not been subjected to official and verified scrutiny because it is not permitted? What level of accountability exists?
              </p>

              <h4>Joe-normous Quest for knowledge</h4>
              <p>
                It's a peculiar situation we find ourselves in, as we heavily rely on democratized sources of information, much like during the internet boom. But how do we verify it? We have to fall back on the old-school ways historians have used since time immemorial - primary and secondary sources, cultural context, and so on. Speaking of which, in the future, we may have validated sources of information that can be used to train models to prevent misuse.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps we can train AI on a wider and more diverse set of resources - both verified and unverified. We can even employ the internet to explore different languages and cultures and translate them into English using AI. Furthermore, why not involve the community? Have users expose our models to cultural ideas and nuances from around the world. We can even design models that flag potential biases or inaccuracies. By citing sources or linking to popular ideas it found, AI can enhance transparency and facilitate critical evaluation of the information.
              </p>

              <h4>Progress</h4>
              <p>
                Technology is an iterative process. It began with text on the internet using HTML (1991), followed by pictures (1994) with captions and audio, and ultimately, the game-changing arrival of YouTube with videos in the late 2000s. It's all about sharing content with the world, right? But what's next? What's the next phase in the communication game? The answer is simple: automating the creation of text, images, videos, and audio. We've already mastered long-distance communication. Now, we move on to something more fundamental - making thinking easier. Imagine a tool that promotes collaboration between individuals and also serves as an expert in their respective fields. It can even target the thinking process before the work is put to paper.
              </p>

              <h4>Overall thoughts?</h4>
              <p>
                It's a noticeable step up, taking us to a different realm that is tied to what existed before. For the past three years, we've seen the openness and early adoption come into play, much like the internet in its infancy.
              </p>
              <p>
                The point is, I have no idea where this technology is going, but I'm excited to see where we will be in two to three years' time from now.
